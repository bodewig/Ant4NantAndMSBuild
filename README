This contains NAnt and MSBuild tasks to run Ant, for documentation
see doc.xhtml.  For the license see the file LICENSE.

I've compiled the code against NAnt 0.85rc3 and the version of MSBuild that
shipped with Visual C# Express in November 2005, the results are
AntTask-NAnt.dll compiled using MS Framework 1.1 (NAnt task only) and
AntTask-FW2.0.dll compiled using MS Framework 2.0 (both tasks).

If you encounter any problems, have suggestions or want to comment in any
other way, feel free to contact me at anttask@stefan.samaflost.de.
